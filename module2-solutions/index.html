			<h2>Sushi</h2>
		    <p>This is an excellent healthy choice for those looking to avoid rice. Sashimi is Grade A cuts of raw fish. Tataki is Grade A cuts of fish seared on the outside with teriyaki and sesame seeds. Each portion comes with 6 pieces. IF you prefer a larger mix of sashimi we can offer the Sashimi Platter which comes with 4 different types of fish.</p>
